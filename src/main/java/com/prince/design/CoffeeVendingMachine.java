    // User can select and buy multiple items at a time. Money can be inputted multiple times (you will get the item if
    // there is a time gap > 30 secs). He can also do window shopping (see only the prices of items and buy nothing)

    // Operator can load the items and mark the items as expired if needed, gets notified if a product goes out of
    // stock.

    // Admin can own multiple vending machines, he should have a analytics report of the items purchased in a month. He
    // can also change the prices directly and it should reflect in all the vending machines which he owns.

    // Exception handling in all the edge cases
