/**
 * Software entities like classes, modules and functions should be open for extension but closed for modifications.
 *
 * If you have a library containing a set of classes, there are many reasons for which you will prefer to extend it
 * without changing the code that was already written (backward compatibility, regression testing, etc.)
 *
 * The Open Close Principle states that the design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new
 * functionality should be added with minimum changes in the existing code.
 *
 * Ex - template and strategy pattern
