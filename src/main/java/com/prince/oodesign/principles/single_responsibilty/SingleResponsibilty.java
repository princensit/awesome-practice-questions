/**
 * A class should have only one reason to change.
 *
 * This principle states that if we have 2 reasons to change for a class, we have to split the functionality in two
 * classes. Each class will handle only one responsibility and on future if we need to make one change we are going to
 * make it in the class which handle it. When we need to make a change in a class having more responsibilities the
 * change might affect the other functionality of the classes.
