/**
 * <pre>
 * The binary heap data structure is an array object that represents a nearly complete binary tree.
 * Thus, each element of the array corresponds to a node of the tree. Heaps are useful data
 * structures for heapsort ,and they are underlying data structure of priority queues.
 *
 * Max-heaps : Returns the maximum element of the collection. Min-heaps : Returns the minimum
 * element of the collection.
 *
 * | Operation        | Time complexity |
 * | Extract min      | O(logn)         |
 * | Insert           | O(logn)         |
 * | Build min heap   | O(n)            |
 * | Decrease key     | O(logn)         |
 * | Get Min          | O(1)            |
 *
 * Heap Property
 * At every node x; Key[x] â‰¤ all keys of x' s children.
 * Root has the minimum key.
